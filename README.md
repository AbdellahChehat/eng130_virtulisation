## What is virtualisation & benefits of it?

- Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system. This enables IT organizations to run more than one virtual system – and multiple operating systems and applications – on a single server. 

### Benefits of virtualisation

- Greater efficiency.
- Increased flexibility
- Better security
- Improved performance
- Improved availability
- Saving money 

## What is dev env?

A development environment in software and web development is a workspace for developers to make changes without breaking anything in a live environment.

## What is vagrant?
Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time

## What is a virtual box?
VirtualBox is open-source software for virtualizing the x86 computing architecture. It acts as a hypervisor, creating a VM (virtual machine) where the user can run another OS (operating system).

- ---------------

BASH scripting – file.sh


`#!/bin/bash` this is must be the first line

Change permission so that file is executable  chmod +x file.sh

to run sudo ./provision.sh
